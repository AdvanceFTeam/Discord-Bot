## Installation 
#### You don't have to read it, if you know how to set it up
- First, open your command prompt or terminal
- Install the 'discord.py' package by running the following command:
```
pip install discord.py
```
- This will install the required package for creating a Discord bot with Python.
- Then add your token to .env so it will work, but if you are using Replit, you can store your Discord token in the System environment variables. Set the environment variable name as `TOKEN`, and assign your Discord token as its value.
```
Create a .env file in the same directory as your Python file.
Open the .env file and add the following line: TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN.
Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token.
Save the .env file.
```
- Now You Can Run the Python file by running the command: `python THE-FILE-Name.py` in your terminal.
