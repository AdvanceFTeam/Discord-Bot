## Installation 
#### Skip this section if you are already familiar with the setup process.

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Install the discord.py package by running the following command
```
pip install discord.py
```
This will install the required package for creating a Discord bot with Python.
3. Add your bot token to the `.env` file to enable its functionality. If you are using Replit, you can store your Discord token in the System environment variables, naming it `TOKEN` and assigning your Discord token as its value.

For the `.env` file setup:
```
- Create a .env file in the same directory as your Python file.
- Open the .env file and add the following line: TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN.
- Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token.
- Save the .env file.
```
4. To run your bot, use the command python `THE-FILE-Name.py` in your terminal.
